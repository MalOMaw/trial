# Trial BLog Platform

The Project has been started to be concerned because I have no clear understanding of what skills and technology should be learned in a real world setting. I can’t rely on “lists” of what fullstack programmer needs, they are just a reference. This project is a mundate, boring start.

A blogging platform incorporates some basic concepts like logging, pagination, databases, requires convenient UI, markup, everything it.
