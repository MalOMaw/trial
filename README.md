# Trial BLog Platform

The Project has been started to be concerned because I have no clear understanding of what skills and technology should be learned in a real world setting. I can’t rely on “lists” of what fullstack programmer needs, they are just a reference. This project is a mundate, boring start.

A blogging platform incorporates some basic concepts like logging, pagination, databases, requires convenient UI, markup, everything it.

It will be written in flask using no javascript frameworks, no css preprocessors.

The project should end at the state where it is a full working product, able to be deployed to a remote server and all minimal functionality is achiveved.
